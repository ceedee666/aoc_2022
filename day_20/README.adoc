== Day 20

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution:

* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)

=== Main idea

Solved today using `deque` from the `collections` module. This was my first idea.
However, I then tried using indices and modulo arithmetic instead. Couldn't get a nice
solution and finally got back to the `deque` approach.


=== What did I learn

=== How to run

Run using:
`$ python day_20.py --help`
