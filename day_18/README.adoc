== Day 18

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution:

* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)

=== Main idea

First I just counted cubes. For the second part I had to change my approach. I implemented
a flooding algorithm to find the outside. After that I calculated all neighbours of the cubes and
counted only the ones visible from the outside.

=== What did I learn

I extended my knowledge of list comprehension. Such a cool feature!

=== How to run

Run using:
`$ python day_18.py --help`
