== Day 07

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution:

* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)

=== Main idea

The main idea of this solution is to build a tree from the commands. The tree is implemented using
dataclasses. The dataclass contains recursive methods to collect all children and to calculate
the total size.


=== What did I learn

I learned a lot about dataclasses, typing and type hints, and enums.

=== How to run

Run using:
`$ python day_07.py --help`
