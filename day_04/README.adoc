== Day ??

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution:

* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)

=== Main idea

The main idea of this solution is to:

* check the boundaries of the ranges
* use the filter function


=== What did I learn

If you type lamdba istead of lambda it can take quite some time to find the error.

=== How to run

Run using:
`$ python day_04.py --help`
