== Day 14

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution:

* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)

=== Main idea

The main idea ist to use a `dict` to represent the cave. `(x,y)` coordinates
are mapped to `"R"` for rocks and `"S"` for sand.
Using this represenatiton it is easy to check if a certain position `(x,y)` is already
in occupied by either a rock or a sand.

Initially I missed the end condition that a grain of sand could fall into the void,
i.e. `y` in creases beyond the maximum `y` of any rock.

=== What did I learn

How to use comprehensions to create `dict`s.

=== How to run

Run using:
`$ python day_14.py --help`
