== Day 15

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution:

* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)

=== Main idea

I did really struggle totday. I tried to create all positions and filter those for part one.
This wouldn't work for part two. So I had to change the approach to calculate which ranges of
a row are covered by the sensors.

=== What did I learn

Regex can be really useful to parse files ;)

=== How to run

Run using:
`$ python day_15.py --help`
