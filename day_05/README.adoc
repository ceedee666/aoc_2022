== Day ??

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution:

* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)

=== Main idea

The main idea of this solution is to use Python list as stacks. This can be done with the
`pop()` and `append()` functions.

=== What did I learn

Parsing text files results in ugly code.

=== How to run

Run using:
`$ python day_05.py --help`
