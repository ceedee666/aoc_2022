== Day ??

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution:
* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)

=== Main idea

The main idea of this solution is to group the data into a list of lists.
Once the data is grouped into a list of lists simple Python functions
like `sum` and `max` can be used to solve the exercise.


=== What did I learn

How to use `.vimspector.json` files to manage debug configurations.

=== How to run

Run using:
`$ python day_01.py --help`
