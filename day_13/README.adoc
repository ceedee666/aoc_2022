== Day 11

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution:

* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)

=== Main idea

The main idea is to implement breath first search to find the shortest path from the start
to the highest point.


=== What did I learn

I struggled a little with finding possible neighbours. It took me some time to realize
that I need to take the hight into account.

=== How to run

Run using:
`$ python day_11.py --help`
