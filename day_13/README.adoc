== Day 13

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution:

* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)

=== Main idea

The main idea is to implement a comparison function for the lists. This
function returns `-1`, `0` or `1` if the first list is smaller, equal,
or larger as the second one. This only became obvious after reading the
second part. Luckily a small refactoring of the solution for part one was
enough to create the comparison function.

Using the comparison function the second part could be solved by simply
using `sorted` together with the comparison function.


=== What did I learn

I learned about `functools.cmp_to_key` today.
=== How to run

Run using:
`$ python day_13.py --help`
