== Day 08

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution:

* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)

=== Main idea

I got a little stuck with the first part today by trying to solve this puzzle using just list comprehension.
I worked on rows and cols separately and tried to combine the results by just summing the visible trees in both.
However, this does not work as it would count some trees multiple times.

Finally, I changed my approach an iterated through the grid using `range`s.

=== What did I learn

If you want to use a `range` to count down the indices of a list be sure
to use `range(start, -1, -1)`. Otherwise some of the elements might be missing.
=== How to run

Run using:
`$ python day_08.py --help`
