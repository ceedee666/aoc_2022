== Day 11

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution:

* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)

=== Main idea

Part one was quite easy. The parsing of the input file was the most complicated part. I used
a `dict` to represent the monkey data. Depending on the operation the mokey performs I
added `operator.add` or `operator.mul` to the dict. This allowed me to just invoke the correct
operation later.

I struggled a litte with the math for part two.


=== What did I learn

I should work on my basic math skills....


=== How to run

Run using:
`$ python day_11.py --help`
