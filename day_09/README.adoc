== Day 09

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution:

* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)

=== Main idea

The main idea is to use a `list` of `lists` to collect the positions of the knots. First the
position of the head is updated with each move. Next the positions of all
following knots is updated. Positions are simply added to the `list`. After all moves where
executed the `list` ist converted to a `set` to get the number visited positions.


=== What did I learn

One shouldn't try to be to clever. Instead of trying to use pattern matching to solve this I
should have gone for the easier `if ... else...` approach.

=== How to run

Run using:
`$ python day_09.py --help`
